# Vowel Recognition Using Cepstral Coefficients and Tokhura's Distance

## Overview
This project processes audio files of vowels, extracts cepstral coefficients, and predicts the vowel spoken using Tokhuraâ€™s distance. The system performs key signal processing steps like DC Shift correction, normalization, steady-state selection, Hamming windowing, autocorrelation, LPC coefficient calculation, cepstral coefficient extraction, and raised sine window application.

## Features
1. **Input Files**: The project processes text files representing audio signals of vowels.
2. **DC Shift & Normalization**: Corrects for DC bias and normalizes the input audio.
3. **Steady State Selection**: Extracts steady-state portions of the vowel sounds.
4. **Hamming Window**: Reduces spectral leakage in the signal.
5. **Autocorrelation & LPC Coefficients**: Computes LPC coefficients using autocorrelation.
6. **Cepstral Coefficients**: Extracts cepstral coefficients for further analysis.
7. **Vowel Prediction**: Utilizes **Tokhura's distance** to predict the vowel from test files.

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: The core C++ file that implements the vowel recognition system.
- `input/`: Folder containing input text files of vowel sounds.
- `output/`: Folder where the processed results (e.g., cepstral coefficients) are saved.
- `test/`: Folder with test files used for vowel prediction.

## Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio).

## How to Run
1. **Clone or Download** the project files to your local machine.
2. **Compile** the `main.cpp` file using any C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o vowel_recognition
   ```
3. **Run the compiled program**:
   ```bash
   ./vowel_recognition
   ```
   - The program will process files in the `input/` folder, generate outputs in the `output/` folder, and predict vowels from files in the `test/` folder.
4. **View Results**: The predicted vowel and other results will be displayed in the terminal, and detailed outputs will be saved in the `output/` folder.

## Key Algorithms
- **DC Shift and Normalization**: Adjusts the audio signals for consistency.
- **Steady State Selection**: Extracts the most stable segment of the vowel sound.
- **Hamming Window**: Applied to minimize spectral leakage.
- **Autocorrelation & LPC Coefficients**: Calculates Linear Predictive Coding coefficients.
- **Cepstral Coefficients**: Extracted from LPC coefficients for effective vowel classification.
- **Tokhura's Distance**: Measures the similarity between test and reference vowels to make predictions.

## Results
- The results will be displayed in the terminal, showing the predicted vowel for each test file.
- Processed data (like cepstral coefficients) will be saved in the `output/` folder.
